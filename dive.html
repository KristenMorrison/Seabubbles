            <p>The Sea Tiger is a former Chinese trading vessel originally named Yun Fong Seong No. 303. It was
                confiscated in the early 1990's for carrying 90+ illegal immigrants into the state of Hawaii. Purchased
                by Voyager Submarines, then cleaned up and sank in 1999 as part of a dive enrichment effort, the Sea
                Tiger is 150-feet of incredible sights.</p>

            <p>Seabubbles is the perfect place to get PADI certified or to book a dive trip and Kirsten was an
                outstanding instructor. She was incredibly calm and encouraging as I took my first breath
                underwater.
                You feel completely safe with her. I even got fresh pineapple between dives!</p><br>
